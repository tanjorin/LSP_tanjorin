Section 1: True/False. (15 pts., 1 pt. each)

T  F When designing a class, each class should be designed to have multiple goals so that your overall design can have fewer classes - F
T  F Inheritance provides a mechanism by which changes to lower-level classes can be propagated to all super classes quickly - F
T  F Design patterns are reusable libraries that can immediately be used in your code - T
T  F Frameworks and design patterns are the same thing as far as designers are concerned - F
T  F Because of potential problems, developers must be aware of the effects of modifications in a superclass and in each of the subclasses that will inherit the modifications. - T
T  F Factory pattern can be combined with other patterns - T
T  F Creational design patterns are all about Class and Object composition.  - F
T  F Structural design patterns are all about class instantiation - F
T  F Design patterns are a mechanism that enable developer to reuse code in their implementations. - T
T  F Behavioral design patterns are all about Class's objects communication - T
T  F Information hiding makes program maintenance software development more difficult because other developer are not privy to an object’s implementation details. - F
T  F In Java, the signature of a method is completely specified by the name of the method and the parameters that must be passed to the method. - T 
T  F The relationship between two objects related by composition cannot be changed at runtime. - F
T  F When iterating a Java HashSet, you are guaranteed to retrieve objects stored in the same order they were inserted - F
T  F Software designs are refactored to allow the creation of software that is easier to integrate - T


















Section 2: Multiple Choice, answer each question. (20 pts., 1 pt. each)

Which of the following option leads to the portability and security of Java?
Bytecode is executed by JVM

What is the role of mocking frameworks like Mockito in unit testing?
They are used to create mock objects for unit tests.

What is the primary purpose of unit testing?
To validate that individual units of code work as expected.


What is regression testing?
Repeating previous tests to ensure existing functionality is not affected by changes.


The root interface of the Java Collection framework hierarchy is
Collection


What interface in the Java Collections framework extends Map and represents a collection of key/value pairs where keys are ordered?
LinkedHashMap

What interface in the Java Collections framework represents a last-in, first-out (Last In First Out) collection of objects?
Stack

Which of the following is true about design patterns? (Choose the best answer). 
All of the above.

You want all the clients using class A to use the same instance of class A when the class is instantiated, what should you do to achieve this goal?  
Apply the Singleton pattern to class A

You have a class that accepts and returns values in British Imperial units (feet, miles, etc.), but you need to use metric units. The design pattern that would best solve your problem is:  
Adapter

Which of the following describes the Facade pattern correctly?
This pattern hides the complexities of the system and providers an interface to the client using which the client can access the system.

Which of the following are concerned with communication between objects?





Which of the following is correct about Creational design patterns?
These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator.

What is the role of the Template Method in the Template Method design pattern?
To define the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

Which of the following describes the Factory pattern correctly? 
This pattern creates an object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refers to newly created objects using a common interface.

In the Command design pattern, what is the purpose of the Command interface?
To encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests.

What is the main advantage of the Strategy design pattern?
It allows the definition of a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

This design pattern should be used to access the contents of a collection without exposing its internal representation, to support multiple traversals of a collection, and to provide a uniform interface for traversing different collections.  
Iterator

Which design pattern should you use when you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem?  
Facade


What is the intent of the Adapter design pattern?
To convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
